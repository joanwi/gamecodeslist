            steps. Follow this guide to claim your rewards:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Launch Anime Adventures</strong> - Open{" "}
              <Link href="https://www.roblox.com/games/9368897716/RE-RELEASE-Anime-Adventures">
                Roblox
              </Link>{" "}
              and start the game on your PC, mobile, or console.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Head to the Codes Area</strong> - From the spawn point in
              the lobby, walk toward the “CODES” sign (it’s a glowing blue
              circle with a star in the center, located near the park area).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Enter the Code</strong> - Stand in the circle, and a text
              box will pop up. Type or paste an active code from the list above.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Hit Redeem</strong> - Click the green “Redeem” button to
              claim your free rewards instantly.

              items will be added to your account automatically!
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Pro Tip: </strong>If a code doesn’t work, try restarting the
            game to join a fresh server—sometimes codes glitch on older builds.

          <h2>What Are Anime Adventures Codes?</h2>
          <p>
            Anime Adventures codes are special giveaways from the game’s
            developers, Gomu, designed to reward players with free in-game
            items. These typically include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Gems</strong> - The primary currency for summoning new
              units via the gacha system.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Summon Tickets</strong> - Free chances to roll for
              powerful anime characters.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Star Remnants & Holiday Stars</strong> - Resources for
              evolving or upgrading your units.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Codes are often released during updates, events (like holidays), or
            when the game hits milestones (e.g., 2 billion visits). They’re a
            quick way to boost your progress without spending Robux or grinding
            for hours.
          </p>
